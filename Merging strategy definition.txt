For a such project where testing is a critical aspect, a combination of the Feature Branch Workflow and Pull Request Workflow is often a solid choice. Here's why:

- Feature branches allow developers to work on features or fixes in isolation, facilitating focused testing.
- Pull requests provide an opportunity for code review and testing before merging into the main branch, ensuring that the code meets quality standards.
- This approach aligns well with the CI/CD pipeline, allowing automated tests to be executed on feature branches and pull requests.
